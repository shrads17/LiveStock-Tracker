### Technologies Used
Frontend
React with TypeScript for a robust and scalable user interface.
Styling
Tailwind CSS for a modern and responsive design.
Real-Time Updates
WebSocket or Firebase integration to enable real-time live tracking.
Mapping
Interactive mapping functionality powered by Leaflet.js.
Distance Tracking
Distances are updated using a geolocation function that adds small, randomized movements within a fixed radius of approximately 50 meters.
Unique offsets ensure that movements are distinct for each animal to simulate real-world behavior.
